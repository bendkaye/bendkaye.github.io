I’m a 26 year old Silicon Valley native with a passion for adventure and solving difficult puzzles. 
Nine months ago, I was turned on to [Reverse Engineering by a childhood friend](https://medium.com/swlh/from-sea-to-shining-c-47c42fccbb21) who thought I would enjoy the challenge.

He wasn’t wrong. 

I’ve spent the past nine months learning x86 and arm assembly, getting comfortable with decompilers, disaasemblers and debuggers. 

The path to a self taught Reverse Engineer is tedious, and I’ve made significant headway since I began my journey.

I built this page to document my journey and expose the projects I’m working on and challenges that I have been able to solve with the hope to inspire/help others that are struggling to enter the field.

## a little about my personal life

I have been living in Israel for almost a decade. Married to my beautiful wife, Chana, for almost three years. We live in a quiet community south of Jerusalem with our two children.

We love to travel together and host random strangers out our home for weekends.
