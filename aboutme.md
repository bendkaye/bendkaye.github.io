I’m a 26 year old Silicon Valley native with a passion for adventure and solving difficult puzzles. 
Nine months ago, I was turned on to [Reverse Engineering by a childhood friend](https://medium.com/swlh/from-sea-to-shining-c-47c42fccbb21) who thought I would enjoy the challenge.

He wasn’t wrong. 

I’ve spent the past nine months learning x86 and arm assembly, getting comfortable with decompilers, disaasemblers and debuggers. 

The path to a self taught Reverse Engineer is tedious, and I’ve made significant headway since I began my journey.

I built this page to document my journey and expose the projects I’m working on and challenges that I have been able to solve with the hope to inspire/help others that are struggling to enter the field.

## a little about my personal life

I have been living in Israel for almost a decade. Married to my beautiful wife, Chana, for almost three years. We live in a quiet community south of Jerusalem with our two children.

We love to travel together and host random strangers at our home on weekends. 

## what I've been up to 


I started off with Linkers & Loaders by Levine and dove straight into Practical Reverse Engineering from Wiley. 

It was exteremely helpful for me to go through the classic C book by Ritchie. Reading his book and doing excersizes from each chapter helps introduce yourself to the concepts necessary to reverse engineer binaries.

RE4B by Dennis Yurichev is my day to day guide while I make my way through the exercizes and challenges in his book. (It’s over 1000 pages)
I pay him personally [for lessons]("https://yurichev.com/news/20210109_teaching/"), and we correspond regularly over my progress. 

As of late, my current focus has been solving "Crack Me's" from [crackme.one]("crackme.one"). I try to solve at least 2 crackme's a day, starting from the beginner challenges. Level 1 beginner challenges are excellent, they are all pretty simple to solve, yet some of the challenges have more advanced methods available for completing them.

I spend some time on Hack the Box challanges, but find them slow paced and less equipt to learning new skills.

Building this site to showcase my work. If you have read this far, I am truly honored that you have taken the time and interest.
