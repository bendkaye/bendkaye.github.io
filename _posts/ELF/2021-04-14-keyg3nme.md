This is the best challenge to start off with, it's really not that difficult and it doesn't take much time to solve. It's always rewarding and validating 
to complete any challenge, so I recommend starting off with this one!

## let's dive right in

If you have any experience in RE, this challenge shouldn't take you more than 15 seconds to solve.

After running the program, it demands a key.

I plug it in to Ghidra, and notice a call to a function “**_validate_key_**.” It returns a boolean, so aside from the obvious name, I’m assured that our answer lies 
somewhere in there.

Double click on the call function "**_validate_key_**" to see what's inside!

Below, I have the decompiled code that was provided by _Ghidra_, and inside you can already see the key.

{% highlight c linenos %}

bool validate_key(int param_1)

{
  return param_1 % 0x4c7 == 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

 I convert our value 0x4c7 from hex to decimal (in ghidra, right click on the value and click on convert) and boom - 1223 is the code!

## a small extra

Technically, part of the challenge is to create a keygen. The simplest way to do this is with python, and it doesn't take more than one line of code.

{% highlight python linenos %}

python3 -c "print('0x4c7', 16)" | ./keyg3nme

{% endhighlight %}
