This was challenging to solve! Ghidra’s decompiler, although an incredibly powerful tool, does not always show you the answer. In this case, it gave a general 
idea of  what to look for in the program, but I still had to go through the assembly line by line. Regardless, this way a GREAT challenge!

## trial by error

I first run the binary in the terminal, and notice it requires a command line argument. I immediately run ltrace, but it doesn’t return anything useful.

The binary is not stripped, so it took seconds to find main after plugging it into Ghidra. Immediately, the decompiler shows me an overview of what’s going on 
inside.

On lines 12 and 13, there are two keys that appear to be XORd by 0x55 in the for loop on line 16.

I write a simple program in C to see if I can crack the first key. **Reminder** - hex goes in “backwards,” so the first byte of _local_1a_ is 0x55.

{% highlight c linenos %}

  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
      char key[8] = {0x55,0x1b,0x3c,0x36,0x30,0x11,0x20,0x31};

      for(int i = 0; i <= 7; i++) {
          char out = key[i] ^ 0x55;   //set to char or it won't print ASCII
          printf("%c", out);
      }
  }

{% endhighlight highlight %}

I compile with GCC, and boom! It looks like we have something!

It seems odd, that ‘NiceDud’ is missing an ‘e’ and that I didn’t seem to need the second key - so I wasn’t surprised when the key failed.

The answer must lie within the second key. As I looked through the program, there didn’t seem to be a call for the second key, _local_12_, at all!

I stare more closely at the counter variable _local_20_ and see what jump condition it has been given.

          LAB_00101257                                     
          00101257 83 7d e8 07     CMP        dword ptr [RBP + local_20],0x7
          0010125b 7e b4           JLE        LAB_00101211
          
At first glance, it appears to skip the jump once 7 has been reached - 7 bytes, starting at 0x55 and finishing at 0x31.

This led me to run through the entire for loop in assembly, frantically searching for a missed instruction.

                             LAB_00101211                                      
        00101211 8b 45 e8        MOV        EAX,dword ptr [RBP + local_20]        <--- takes counter, points it to EAX
        00101214 83 c0 01        ADD        EAX,0x1                               <--- increments

                 05 ee

        00101221 89 c1           MOV        ECX,EAX                               <--- stores in ECX

        0010122e 8b 45 e8        MOV        EAX,dword ptr [RBP + local_20]
        00101231 48 98           CDQE
        00101233 48 01 d0        ADD        RAX,RDX
        00101236 0f b6 00        MOVZX      EAX,byte ptr [RAX]
        00101239 38 c1           CMP        CL,AL                                 <--- user input & key XOR are compared
        0010123b 74 16           JZ         LAB_00101253

I noticed	something interesting in the **RAX** register, it seemed to be pointing to _local_20_  and then adding 1. Maybe that was how we accessed the second key? 
_local_20_ holds a value that is compared by the _for loop_, yet in reality, because of incrementing RAX, it’s pointing to a byte that’s one ahead of the counter?

I run the program through GDB to see what’s going on:
<img width="830" alt="426527401" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46263689/122356811-d526de80-cf5b-11eb-9f81-c84fa277b49c.png">

RAX is 0, then get’s added  by one!

This explains why 0x55 isn’t counted at all (even though we wouldn’t see it when running my C program, because 0x55 ^ 0x55 = 0) and it also explains how 
we could overflow into the second key!

0x30 ^ 0x55 = 0x65, which in ASCII is equal to ‘e’!!!!

Unfortunately, while that does solve the program, and explains the answer of overflow into the second key, the program overflows without my elaborate explanation.

local_20 is incremented at the end of the for loop and breaks if greater than 7. 

## in summary

This was a sweet challenge, and I definitely broke my head on it for much longer than necessary. Even though I could have given up and solved the challenge, it
was important for me to make sure I fully understood everything that was going on in the assembly. In the end of the day, there is no magic. Nothing happens by
accident, and the program will not XOR the second key without explicitly being told to do so.

As long as I can keep that in my head, I'll make it in life as a Reverse Engineer!
