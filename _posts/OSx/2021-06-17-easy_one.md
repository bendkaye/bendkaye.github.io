A nice little warm-up crack me for OSx. I did need to look at the assembly to solve it, but it only took me about 5 minutes.

## suspicious Cupertino

Run the program, it wants a password. Let’s give it one at random.

Because of System Integrity Protection (SIP) on OSx, you can’t simply run dtrace (the OSx alternative to ltrace) without disabling SIP. I didn’t attempt it for 
this challenge, because it’s not necessary for solving but [here](“https://poweruser.blog/using-dtrace-with-sip-enabled-3826a352e64b”) is a simple guide for doing
so.

I charge up Ghidra and plug in my binary.

The decompiler shows us three functions of interest: 


{% highlight c linenos %}

fgets() // stores user input in _local_118_
strcspn() // records location of “\n” in _local_118_
strlen() // counts length of _local_118_
  
{% endhighlight highlight %}

Line 14 changes the line break into a null byte, “\0”. It’s important for this program to work, as you will shortly see.

On line 17, the decompiler shows a comparison between the first bit of _local_118_ and _local_10f_.

      100000e42 0f be 85        MOVSX      EAX,byte ptr [RBP + local_118]
                 f0 fe ff ff
      100000e49 0f be 8d        MOVSX      ECX,byte ptr [RBP + local_10f]
                 f9 fe ff ff
      100000e50 39 c8           CMP        EAX,ECX
      
### What is inside local_10f?

fgets() overflows into it! 

User input must be 10 letters long, but _local_118_  was only allocated 9 bits, and fgets() allocated over 100!

This challenge allows you to buffer overflow the buffer, writing the last letter of user input to the variable _local_10f_.

This means that as long as the user input is 10 characters long, and the first letter matches the last - it will solve the challenge!
